# Who am I?
My name is Daniel Samogin Campioni, I was born in 23/Aug/2000 at Campinas - SP, Brazil. I'm a Unity game developer with 5+ years of experience mainly focused on gameplay mechanics and software engineering, but also with lots of hours dedicated to UI and process automation in Unity.

## Work experiences
I have worked in big games with more than 10 million downloads, namely:

- [PK XD](https://en.playpkxd.com/) (100M+);
- [Crafty Lands](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.playkids.voxel) (10M+).

I can also mention other projects not entirely game-related but also with lots of users, such as:

- [PlayKids App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.playkids) (10M+);
- [KODE Virtual Assistant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.playkids.explorer) (100k+).

### Code languages
Throughout my carrer I have worked with many different languages, varying by what was necessary for the project in question:

- C# (the one I used the most by far at work);
- Python (university).

Honorable mentions:

- Kotlin;
- C++;
- Swift.

## Academic experiences
Since when I was 6 years old I have always studied at public schools/university in Brazil, most notably:

- COTUCA (Unicamp's Technical High School)
    - From 2015 to 2017;
    - Completed High School;
    - Completed informatics technician course.
- Unicamp (University)
    - Since 2018 (haven't finished yet);
    - Bachelor degree in Computer Science.

## Spoken languages
I lived my whole live in Brazil so I'm a native Portuguese speaker, but since 2014 everything I touch related to technology is in English (YouTube, games, social media, ...) and I have also finished my English course with a proficiency level of C1 (CEFR).
Recently (Jan/2023) I have started learning Italian but I still don't know a lot of things about the language.

- Native Portuguese;
- Advanced English;
- Basic Italian.

## Curiosities
1. Here are some code languages I would run away from:
    - Objective-C;
    - PHP;
    - Java;

2. I'm in the top 150 best players at 3v3 from Brazil in Rocket League, spending only 3200h+ in the game;
3. Maybe in the near future I'll officially be an Italian citizen as well, that's why I'm learning to speak Italian.

Whenever you start a new Unity project you usually already have some codebase which to build upon, mostly with "Utils" classes/files. In this post I'll talk about a simple one that I have implemented for some personal projects of mine, more specifically a translation system (or a Location Provider) using a Google Sheet as the main database.

## Requirements
- Unity 2022+ with an account
- Google account


....


## Improvements
- Add Addressables to the mix!

## Questions

### Why Google Sheets?
### Where can I find the full implementation?
### What about security?
